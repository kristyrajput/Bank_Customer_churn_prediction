"Predicting the likelihood of customers leaving a bank using classification models, helping financial institutions improve customer retention strategies."


🏦 Bank Customer Churn Predictor
A Predictive Analytics project that identifies customers who are likely to leave (churn) the bank.


📌 Project Overview
Retaining existing customers is much cheaper than acquiring new ones. This project uses Machine Learning to predict customer churn based on their credit score, balance, tenure, and activity status. By identifying "at-risk" customers, the bank can take proactive measures like offering special discounts or personalized services to retain them.


🚀 Key Features
Behavioral Analysis: Analyzes how factors like Balance, Age, and IsActiveMember affect a customer's decision to stay.

Churn Indicators: Identifies that Age and Balance are often the strongest predictors of churn.

Proactive Strategy: Helps the marketing team target specific customers before they close their accounts.

Interactive Dashboard: A Streamlit app where bank managers can input customer details and see the "Exit Probability."
